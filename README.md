# FailFund – Stay Accountable. Achieve Your Goals. Or Pay The Price.

**FailFund** is a goal-setting platform where users commit to a goal — and put real money on the line. If they succeed, they keep their pledge. If they fail, they’re automatically charged. It’s built for accountability, not willpower.

> “Turn good intentions into real outcomes — with consequences.”

## 💡 Why I Built This

Too many productivity apps rely on motivation — which fades. I wanted to build a platform that makes failure costly, using behavioral psychology and automation to keep people on track.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- Stripe’s payment flow (setup intents, auto charges)
- Authentication with NextAuth
- Building full-featured dashboards in Next.js
- User experience that balances motivation with pressure

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Goal Tracking Dashboard**  
  Update progress manually or through integrations like Strava.

- **Real Stakes**  
  Stripe securely stores payment methods and automatically charges users if they miss a deadline.

- **Flexible Deadlines**  
  Users can set daily, weekly, or monthly goals — tracked with live countdown timers.

- **Accountability by Design**  
  Users pick an "enemy" where their pledge goes if they fail. It’s motivation with teeth.
